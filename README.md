# BEng-Thesis---Simulation-of-a-controllable-bionic-prosthesis-implementing-selected-types-of-grasps

The topic of my BEng Thesis was ''Simulation of a controllable bionic prosthesis implementing selected types of grasps''.

The aim of the thesis was to introduce the problem of simulation of bionic prosthesis.

I developed the work using Nvidia Isaac Sim simulator and Shadow Dexterous Hand (https://github.com/shadow-robot/simox_ros).

First, I set up the environment in Isaac Sim and imported the model, taking into account the changes I needed.
Then I developed the control of the model using the keyboard to be able to control it in real time during the simulation. I used the OmniGraphs, which came with Isaac Sim.

The final result of the work was a controllable bionic prosthesis that could perform any type of grasp.

The folders contain simulations and photos of the corresponding gestures and grasps.
